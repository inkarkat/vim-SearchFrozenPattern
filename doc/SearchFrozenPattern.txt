DESCRIPTION				     *SearchFrozenPattern-description*

Most of the navigation in Vim is done with searches. Often, one even builds
searches (different branches to search for) by jumping around buffer(s) and
adding stuff to the current search. For this kind of "meta-searching", it
would be great if a different search could be used that is not affected by
changes to the current search pattern.

This plugin provides commands and mappings to "freeze" a search pattern.
Plugin mappings allow to navigate to next / previous matches of this memorized
pattern, even if the current search pattern changes. You basically get a
second set of search navigation mappings that works independently of the
built-in |n| / |N|. If you use the optional SearchRepeat plugin, its n / N
overloads can be quickly switched from the frozen pattern to the current one,
and back.

HOW IT WORKS								     *

The |SearchSpecial.vim| plugin provides custom search capabilities. This
plugin saves the current / specified search pattern, and feeds that to it. You
get search navigation that works like the built-in one, but is independent of
|quote/| and 'hlsearch'.

SEE ALSO								     *

- The |SearchAsQuickJump.vim| plugin (vimscript #5619) allows to perform
  searches without affecting the current search pattern. Unlike with this
  plugin, the pattern needs to be input / based on the current word.
- The |mark.vim| plugin (vimscript #2666) can search for multiple patterns in
  parallel, using special mappings. It also highlights each pattern in a
  different way.
- The |HistoryRecall.vim| plugin (vimscript #0000) has mappings that allow to
  quickly recall previous search patterns from the search history.
- The |SearchAlternatives.vim| plugin (vimscript #4146) is a great companion
  to add branches to the current search pattern. Together with this plugin,
  you can use a single (frozen) search pattern to locate stuff, and then add
  selected matches to the current search pattern.
- Check out the |SearchSpecial.vim| plugin page (vimscript #4948) for a full
  list of special searches powered by it.
- Check out the |SearchRepeat.vim| plugin page (vimscript #4949) for a full
  list of custom searches that integrate with it.

==============================================================================
USAGE						   *SearchFrozenPattern-usage*
							       *:SearchFreeze*
:SearchFreeze [/{pattern}/[{offset}]]
			Keep searching for {pattern} / the last search pattern
			(with |gof| / |gOf|) even if the search pattern
			changes (via any of the built-in search commands like
			|/|, |star|, etc.) The command jumps to the next
			occurrence of the pattern.
								  *<Leader>/f*
<Leader>/f		Keep searching for the current search pattern
			(|quote/|) even if the search pattern changes. The
			mapping does not jump on its own.

The special searches all start with 'go...' (mnemonic: "go once to special
match"); and come in search forward (go...) and backward (gO...) variants.

								   *gof* *gOf*
[count]gof / gOf	Search forward / backward to the [count]'th occurrence
			of the quick search pattern. This is the equivalent to
			the default |n| / |N| search repeat commands.

EXAMPLE						 *SearchFrozenPattern-example*

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				    *SearchFrozenPattern-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-SearchFrozenPattern
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Stable releases are on the "master" branch, the latest
unstable snapshot on "develop".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SearchFrozenPattern*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				    *SearchFrozenPattern-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |SearchSpecial.vim| plugin (vimscript #4948), version 1.20 or
  higher.
- SearchRepeat.vim (vimscript #4949) plugin, version 2.00 or higher (optional)

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				   *SearchFrozenPattern-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
						   *SearchFrozenPattern-remap*
If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>(SearchFrozenPattern...) mapping targets _before_ sourcing the script
(e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    nmap gof <Plug>(SearchFrozenPatternNext)
    nmap gOf <Plug>(SearchFrozenPatternPrev)
    nmap <Leader>/f <Plug>(SearchFrozenPatternFreeze)
<
==============================================================================
INTEGRATION				     *SearchFrozenPattern-integration*

If the SearchRepeat plugin is installed, a parallel set of "go now and for
next searches" mappings (starting with 'gn...' instead of 'go...') is
installed. These mappings have the same effect, but in addition re-program the
'n/N' keys to repeat this particular search (until another gn... search is
used).
